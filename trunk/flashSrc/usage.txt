You'll need the Flash 9 Pre-alpha or Flash CS3 to compile these Flash movies.

To use these flash movies, export as an .EXE (Flash projector) and run. You'll need to start FLOSC and the touchlib OSC application. FLOSC serves as the bridge between OSC and Flash. The OSC app will send TUIO events to the Flash movie. 

To make your own flash apps, you need only import the TUIO.as file and call TUIO.init (see the source for details). Then you can add listeners to your MovieClips for the TUIO events (MoveEvent, UpEvent, DownEvent, RollOverEvent, RollOutEvent).
