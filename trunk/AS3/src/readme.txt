Hello,

Here is a breif overview of the Touchlib AS3 project:

src - Flash CS3 source and deployment assets
lib - internal libraries
ext - external libraries (papervision, tweener, etc..)

com.touchlib

app.demo.core.object - objects that can be rendered on screen (ImageObject, VideoOject)
app.demo.core.element - interactive objects that typically act as controllers (Knob, Slider)
app.demo.core.action - Actions that objects can extend (Rotate/Scale)
app.demo.core.utl - 
app.demo.core


Here is some general guidelines to follow when building demo applications.



//Structuring
------------------------------------------------
Think of the app.demo folder as you would Windows Program files, all application classes and assets 
go into a folder. For example: 

Also if you would like to put a lisense on the application please do so in a readme.txt file within this folder. 
 

//Development
------------------------------------------------

Document Class
Source Paths





//Deployment
------------------------------------------------
www - dynamic web objects 
local - dynamic local objects




//Notes
--------
c.moore: developers please let me know if have any ideas.

When commiting new applications please keep graphics to minimum, exclude things like background 
and text objects unless necessary for programs operation. If possible put on solid black background.
